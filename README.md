## Repository Directory

### Code
The notebook code we used predominantly for this project on Kaggle is contained in the nfl-big-data-bowl.r file. The only code not contained in this file is the code to make the tables and extract the data set we use. All code can additionally be found in the code folder where it has been broken down into five files. In order it goes: creating the new dataframes, in zone master dataset, animation, metrics and cluster, graphs and tables. Additionally, all code progress can be seen in the version history on Kaggle. 

### Visuals
All visuals used for our submission are included, in better quality. The lower-quality images used for memory requirements on Kaggle are also included in the reduced_size folder.
